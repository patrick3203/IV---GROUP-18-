<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
<a href="https://gyazo.com/aa763fdcfe052edad5a8b0c879bdca06"><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/aa763fdcfe052edad5a8b0c879bdca06.png" alt="Team OCEAN personality test traits result" width="536"/></a>

<p>Each members’ personality test result is as follows:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Ary: ENTP & Tactile learner</li>
<li>Melanie: ESFP-T & Tactile/Kinesthetics</li>
<li>Patrick: ESFJ-T & Tactile</li>
<li>Derek: ISFJ & Auditory</li>
<li>Angel: ISFJ-T & Visual</li>
<li>Hien: INFP-A & Auditory/Visual</li>
</ul>

<p>The team consists of three extraverts and three introverts, however, this does not determine our team's compatibility. According to the test results, each member is somewhat compatible with one another. By acknowledging each other's personality type, we are able to gather insights on everyone's strengths and weaknesses in regards to teamwork. One member's weakness is another member's strength. With this in mind, we can use this to our advantage and allocate roles in favour of our strongest traits.</p>
 
<p>Ary's ENTP personality is the type who enjoys thinking in creative ways and as the “thinking type”, is someone who uses logical reasoning rather than acting out of emotion, which is an important trait to have when working in a team. Melanie's type allows her to work well in a team as ESFP's are verbal and assertive, as well as are open to ideas that may challenge their own without conflict. Patrick, as an ESFJ, is someone that is a logical thinker and follows their mind over their heart. They're very organized and intuitive, their strengths being organization and problem-solving. Both Derek and Angel are ISFJ types. The test reflects that though they may be shy, they will get tasks done on time. They're patient with given tasks whilst having a much steady and straight forward approach to help achieve the end goal. Lastly, Hien is an INFP, which are usually the types who bring unity to a team. They're creative and are innovative thinkers who are highly oriented to action. <br>

The tests are sometimes vague and not always 100% accurate, so regardless of personality type, each member already knows what they are capable of and we will communicate that the more we work together. </p>

<h3>Ideal Jobs</h3>
<p><b>Ary:</b><br> 
My ideal job would be as a Software Engineer, working in multidisciplinary projects and applying concepts of engineering to develop software. This position interests me because I enjoy to think in creative ways and to work in a team. The technical skills required are understanding of different programming languages and testing frameworks.</p>

<p><b>Melanie:</b><br>
Currently, my ideal job is a Junior Data Scientist. The main focus of the job involves working with businesses and technology teams, while applying data analysis and data modelling skills to enhance company products/services before offering it to clients. This position appeals to me because it is a great graduate level job that requires a lot of teamwork and data analysis, which I enjoy. The job could potentially lead to better opportunities and help further my career goals as a data scientist.</p>

<p><b>Derek:</b><br>
Data and Business Intelligence analyst is a job position in a company that gathers data and turns the data into information that can be used to help aid the businesses decision making often through interpreting the data gathered. It is appealing to me because I enjoy interpreting data and analyzing the information to then come up with a solution to a problem that is supported through the data gathered. The skills required for this position is that you will need to know programming languages, be good at problem solving, creating/analyzing data and expressing the data, teamwork and have a decent knowledge in the mathematical field.</p>

<p><b>Patrick: </b><br>
The ideal IT job for me would be within the Cybersecurity field. Specifically, I would like to work in the Cyber Risk department for a large organization. I like the problem-solving aspect of Cyber Risk, you are presented with new challenges every day that must be solved. As well you must be able to effectively and clearly communicate with team members which is something I feel I am good at. The requirements for this type of position are typically a Bachelor degree in a related field, as well as a few years of experience in the Cybersecurity field.</p>

<p><b>Angel:</b><br>
My ideal job will be a Network Security field, more specifically working at two main areas: application security and data loss prevention. Application security ensures that applications are protected from the attackers by accessing the network. Data loss prevention implements technologies and processes to ensure that staffers don’t deliberately or inadvertently send sensitive data outside the network.</p>

<p>The ideal fields for each group member are: software engineering, data science, data and business intelligence analysis, cyber security and network security. </p>

<p>One of the common job interests are data science and data/business intelligence analysis, where some of the shared skills include data modelling, knowledge in programming languages, problem solving, creating/analyzing data, expressing data, teamwork and having a decent knowledge in the mathematical field. Another common job interest amongst our team is cybersecurity and network security, where some skills are in risk analysis and mitigation, intrusion detection, security analysis, programming languages and malware analysis and reversing. Although software engineering is of a different field, there are similar skills needed such as programming languages and problem solving. Another required skill that everyone will need is great teamwork and strong communication. </p>

<p>In software engineering, the focus is on applying concepts of engineering to develop software, which is different from data science and analysis, where they aid businesses and enhance company products through analysing data. There is also a contrast when compared to security, where the attention is on security and data loss prevention with aspects of problem solving. Although each member has a different role of interest, we share a common goal that is to succeed in our careers. In regards to career plans, the team has similarities in which we want to complete our Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology, get internships, begin networking and make our way up in the IT industry.</p>
