<h1> Interview 2: <h1/>
<h1> Interviewee: Daniel Nowlin <h1/>
<ul>
<li><strong>What is your IT job and what is it about? What type of work do you do?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I am an IT Manager for Hatfield Media, we are based out of Louisville, Kentucky, USA. My work varies from help to desk overseeing all IT operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What is the industry you work in? (Is it a software development company or is accounting/business analytics or something else?)</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our business is a consultancy that creates videos, websites, and programs for specific customers&rsquo; needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>Who are the different people you interact with?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I interact with pretty much every employee in the company. If any IT issues show themselves, I am first on the scene. From high ranking executives, to the traditional desk worker.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What aspects of your work do you spend most of your time on?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I spend the most time on new projects, right now we are creating a storage server for all the video editors to work off. This has been an exciting new task for me to work on and learn about.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>How has the IT industry changed when you first started working?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I first started, we had to do most of the work in person. However, 90% of my work can be done remotely from home now. That is a negative and a positive because the work is accessible, but at the same time I am always on call. I have been in the industry for just over 10 years now.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What did you find the most challenging when you first entered the IT industry?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The end user. I struggled a lot with explaining issues to people. I must remember that not everyone is a &ldquo;tech head&rdquo; like me so I must explain in the most basic way possible. I still struggle with that sometimes.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>How long have you been working for this company and how do you feel about your career in general?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been working for this company for 2 and a half years now, I have made good progress in my career so far and I feel fortunate to be at this company. I am a good fit and I feel comfortable.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What sort of expectations should young adults have when entering the IT industry?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Young adults should expect to do basic help desk jobs for the beginning of their career. This teaches you how to work with different systems, and more importantly how to work with people. The pay is not that great, however there's a lot of growth to be made from there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What advice would you give to young adults entering the IT industry?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Work hard and gain as much knowledge as you can. When you feel stuck in one position, shop around jobs and see what is out there. Use every opportunity you have to gain experience over your whole career, however especially when you are young.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><strong>What do you love the most about your career?</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I love that I wake up and I love what I do. I know that sounds clich&eacute; however it is true. I wake up in the morning and look forward to the tasks that lay ahead. I cannot imagine myself in any other career. If it were not for IT I do not know where I would be today.</p>
<p>Summary: Daniels interview really gave me a lot of insight into the mind of an IT professional. His knowledge of his career and how he could have accelerated his progress is incredible. Throughout his interview I could tell that Daniel has a true passion for IT and was a good source for information. His most important message to me was that if you love what you do and you are passionate about what you do you will be successful. Work will not feel like work if you love what you are doing.</p>
