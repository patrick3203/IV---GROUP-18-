<h1> Feedback </h1>
<p>Melanie has been an extremely active member of the group. She is always on task and has been very productive. She has completed all work that was assigned to her and is always first to volunteer when something needs to be completed.</p>
<p>Derek is also very proactive member of the group. He is active in all the communication channels and completes his work without any extra attention needed. He contributed a lot to the project idea, and always has a thought on how we can improve.</p>
<p>Ary has become our primary group leader. He is always pushing the conversation forward and delegating jobs to people. He is a good personality and a great group member and contributor. He has a great understanding of the assignment and has good thoughts on what we should do. He brings a different point of view being from Brazil and how the IT industry is there.</p>
<p>Hien has a bit of tricky scenario because of a big mix up of him only being added to our Google Doc collaboration assignments and not our Microsoft Teams group. As well in Canvas an alternative Hien Tran was added to our group there as well creating a massive confusion. However, once he joined the group, he brought great HTML knowledge with him. He has been a big help in creating our website and putting all our contributions together onto the website.</p>

<h1> Group Reflection </h1>
<p> I was surprised on how well our group got to know one another and we have become friends with one another. Other groups I have worked with have been strictly business, I can see being friends with all these group members well after this class concludes. I think that our conversations when on our calls could be improved. They can have a lot of tangents which can be distracting, it is sometimes my fault and I need to work on that. One thing I have learned while working in this group is everyone works differently, and it is a &ldquo;give n take&rdquo; relationship. You need to adapt to how your other group members work. I believe that the GitHub contribution branches are not a good reflection of our individual contributions. For example, Hien does not have a contribution branch because of his situation however he has made most of, if not all our website. Another example would be that I have combined all our individual contributions for the sections of the project into one main file and put it in the master branch. That work will not be reflected in my contribution branch. However other members have all their work in there. The branches can be used as a supplement to the feedback; however, they do not tell the entire story of the contributions.</p>
