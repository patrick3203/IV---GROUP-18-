<p>What does Cyber Security do? Who needs Cyber Security? Why do people need Cyber security? Those are three questions that crucial to ask any idea, technology based or not. Cyber Security is a very broad term that has many use cases and specialities within it. What Cyber Security does it exactly what the name state, it is the security of the internet. Everyone needs Cyber Security, it protects everything from your bank accounts, to people turning on your smart oven in the middle of the night. Cyber Security is in everything and is an extremely important aspect of computing.</p>
<p>When I say that everyone needs Cyber Security, I am simply elaborating on the idea that your data has a price tag and should be protected. Your data is yours; nobody should be able to come in a view it or take it as they please. Yours data should be protected and if your data is comprised you should be notified immediately to act. Cyber Security is used in banks, grocery stores, online commerce, and every form of online computing. Cyber Security is used in many different applications. Most commonly, the basic user will recognize the use of &ldquo;security questions&rdquo; as an authentication to authenticate the user and confirm you are who you say you. This is most used when accessing sensitive materials or attempting to change login information. However, on the back end, which the user can consider &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo;, Cyber Security is everywhere. A CAPTCHA is another user recognizable form of Cyber Security. A <em>CAPTCHA</em> is used to distinguish a real, alive person to a robot. <em>CAPTCHA</em> does not say how exactly they do this, because the point is for it is not beaten. That being said, it is confirmed that <em>CAPTCHA</em> uses many variables to help form a decision on if the user is a person or not. These variables can be cursor accuracy, time to complete task, task completion percentage, and the IP address the user is accessing from. Cursor accuracy is commonly used because a robot or basically anything that is not a person will point exactly to where they need to go. A person on the other hand may hover around the page with their cursor before finally executing the task. Even at it&rsquo;s very best, CAPTCHA can still be beaten, or alternatively turn away a human. This creates a frustrating user experience, and nobody wants that. The next step would be a 100% source of authenticate that is hassle-free and cannot be tricked or deceived by another computer. There are many other use cases of Cyber Security however I felt that these were the two most user relatable cases, they are cases that users see and interact with extremely often when browsing online.</p>
<p>Cyber Security has a large impact on we the user, and usually the customer interacts with the internet as we know it. The <em>CAPTCHA&nbsp;</em>development mentioned earlier is a great example of a Cyber Security development that is on-going and creating a much more secure internet. As this technology improves, users should expect their online banking portals and other sensitive data to be much more secure, with no added difficulty for the user. In a perfect scenario the user is uninterrupted in their browsing, and behind the scenes, in the back end of the website, the user is authenticated and granted access. However, I believe that we are still quite a while away from that &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; internet. That task comes with great technological challenges, security challenges, and most importantly legislative challenges. Legislative challenges are when a governing body must approve the use of the technology, this can become a challenge when the technology is brand new and not completely understood by legislators and representatives. I believe that in order to achieve the &ldquo;seamless experience&rdquo; data such as cookies and browsing history would need to be read by the website. This creates an issue with reading people&rsquo;s data without their permission, as touched on early in this report.</p>
<p>In my daily life, in the perfect scenario, my online browsing experience becomes seamless and all authentication happens in the background. This would drastically increase my productivity online when logging in and attempting to view sensitive materials. As of right now, every time I login to my bank accounts online, I must answer security questions or complete a challenge. This task usually takes about 15 seconds and when doing that multiple times, a day, the time really begin to add up. Over the time span of years, this could save me many minutes or even hours allowing me to be more productive with that time saved. Perhaps even finish more university assignments. My family friends that own a concrete cutting business would extremely benefit from a &ldquo;seamless experience&rdquo;. Kimberly, who is the co-owner of the company spends multiple minutes every day when logging into their job calendar, website for bidding on jobs, system that pays employees, and the bank. The time she would save would be many times greater than I would. She could use that time to create more revenue for the company, growing the company quicker, and expanding her business.</p>
