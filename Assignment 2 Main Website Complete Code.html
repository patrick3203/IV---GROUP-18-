<h3> Personal Information </h3>

<h2> Ary Ramires - s3857679 <a href="https://basicwebprofile.s3.amazonaws.com/project_out01.html" target=”_blank”>(Assignment 1 Link)</a></h2>


<p class="box"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrick3203/IV---GROUP-18-/Ary-Contribution/Ary.picture.square.JPG" target=”_blank”><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrick3203/IV---GROUP-18-/Ary-Contribution/Ary.picture.square.JPG" alt="Ary.picture.square.JPG" width="200" class="float-img"></a>
	I came from Brazil 6 years ago and I was supposed to stay only for a year to become fluent in English. After my first months, I had grown to love this country and decided I wanted to stay. My past work experience is in the area of customer and property services. Working as an operational supervisor, I was in charge of managing staff and overseeing commercial cleaning operations.<br> 
	Some of my hobbies include endurance road cycling, going on a hike with friends and I enjoy going to film festivals in Melbourne. My IT experience is limited to my years of high school when I took a course to learn how to create and code soccer playing robots. That was very fun and rewarding and has motivated me to pursue a career in IT. Also, I am attracted to how technologies are constantly developing and particularly to how those changes can impact business and people. <br>
	Working on a variety of teams and projects during my career is something I am definitely looking forward to.</p>

	I was born in Australia, but my ethnicity is half Cambodian and half Chinese. My hobbies include, hiking, bouldering and any sort of outdoor activity that involves a kick of adrenaline. After graduating from High School, I took a gap year then proceeded to do half a semester in an Associate’s Degree of Science. I didn't enjoy it much, so I stopped the course in the second semester to apply for a Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology. My main interest in IT is in programming. Although it is frustrating at times and can be very difficult, the end result is satisfying. Having your code run successfully gives a sense of accomplishment, which makes it so enjoyable. Before starting a Bachelor’s Degree in IT, I had very little IT experience, however, my knowledge is growing and I hope to gain more experience.

	I was born in Australia, while both my parents came from China. I can speak and understand both Chinese and English. I enjoy playing sports especially basketball where I played for a club (Central City Breakers) and swimming when I took lessons. I am in the Bachelor of Information Technology Course where I have a major interest in the data science area of IT. I have little knowledge in the IT field however I hope to learn it in more detail as IT is always evolving and achieving new heights.

	I am 19 years old and I am a Full-Time international student originally from the United States. I am a first year student in the Bachelor of IT program. I fly drones in my spare time, as well I am an amateur boxer. I speak English as my primary language however I am moderately proficient in Spanish. My interest comes from wanting to know how everything works, I extend that curiosity to computers. The feeling you receive after successfully completing something you’ve been working on for weeks keeps me going. It’s the pinnacle of all the hours of work you put in and now it is represented all in one area.

<h2> Angel He - s3845798 <a href="">(Assignment 1 Link)</a></h2>
	<p class="box"> 
	I am an 19 year old boy from mainland China. My family immigrated from China to Melbourne in 2014, and since then I started High School here. My parents both can speak fluent Spanish because they used to work in a South American country called Argentina, but unfortunately, I never had a chance to learn Spanish with them because they are always busy with their work. My interest in IT is network security, although I only have little knowledge about it but I would really like to learn more about it.

<h3> Test Results </h3>
<a href="https://gyazo.com/aa763fdcfe052edad5a8b0c879bdca06" target=”_blank”><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/aa763fdcfe052edad5a8b0c879bdca06.png" alt="Image from Gyazo" width="536"/></a>
<h5>Our Big Five personality test.</h5>

<h2> Each members' personality test result is as follows: </h2>
	<p> 
	<strong>Ary: </strong>ENTP & Tactile learner
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Melanie: </strong>ESFP-T & Tactile/Kinesthetic
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Patrick: </strong>ESFJ-T & Tactile
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Derek: </strong>ISFJ & Auditory
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Angel: </strong>ISFJ-T & Visual
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<strong>Hien: </strong>INFP-A & Auditory/Visual
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The team consists of three extraverts and three introverts, however, this does not determine our team's compatibility. According to the test results, each member is somewhat compatible with one another. By acknowledging each other's personality type, we are able to gather insights on everyone's strengths and weaknesses in regards to teamwork. One member's weakness is another member's strength. With this in mind, we can use this to our advantage and allocate roles in favour of our strongest traits.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Ary's ENTP personality is the type who enjoys thinking in creative ways and as the “thinking type”, is someone who uses logical reasoning rather than acting out of emotion, which is an important trait to have when working in a team. Melanie's type allows her to work well in a team as ESFP's are verbal and assertive, as well as are open to ideas that may challenge their own without conflict. Patrick, as an ESFJ, is someone that is a logical thinker and follows their mind over their heart. They're very organized and intuitive, their strengths being organization and problem-solving. Both Derek and Angel are ISFJ types. The test reflects that though they may be shy, they will get tasks done on time. They're patient with given tasks whilst having a much steady and straight forward approach to help achieve the end goal. Lastly, Hien is an INFP, which are usually the types who bring unity to a team. They're creative and are innovative thinkers who are highly oriented to action. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The tests are sometimes vague and not always 100% accurate, so regardless of personality type, each member already knows what they are capable of and we will communicate that the more we work together. 
	</p>

<h3> Ideal Jobs </h3>

	<h2> Ary: </h2>
	<p>
	My ideal job would be as a Software Engineer, working in multidisciplinary projects and applying concepts of engineering to develop software. This position interests me because I enjoy to think in creative ways and to work in a team. The technical skills required are understanding of different programming languages and testing frameworks.
	<p>
	<h2> Melanie: </h2>
	<p>
	Currently, my ideal job is a Junior Data Scientist. The main focus of the job involves working with businesses and technology teams, while applying data analysis and data modelling skills to enhance company products/services before offering it to clients. This position appeals to me because it is a great graduate level job that requires a lot of teamwork and data analysis, which I enjoy. The job could potentially lead to better opportunities and help further my career goals as a data scientist.
	<p>
	<h2> Derek: </h2>
	<p>
	Data and Business Intelligence analyst is a job position in a company that gathers data and turns the data into information that can be used to help aid the businesses decision making often through interpreting the data gathered. It is appealing to me because I enjoy interpreting data and analyzing the information to then come up with a solution to a problem that is supported through the data gathered. The skills required for this position is that you will need to know programming languages, be good at problem solving, creating/analyzing data and expressing the data, teamwork and have a decent knowledge in the mathematical field.
	<p>
	<h2> Patrick: </h2>
	<p>
	The ideal IT job for me would be within the Cybersecurity field. Specifically, I would like to work in the Cyber Risk department for a large organization. I like the problem-solving aspect of Cyber Risk, you are presented with new challenges every day that must be solved. As well you must be able to effectively and clearly communicate with team members which is something I feel I am good at. The requirements for this type of position are typically a Bachelor degree in a related field, as well as a few years of experience in the Cybersecurity field.
	<p>
	<h2> Angel </h2>
	<p>
	My ideal job will be a Network Security field, more specifically working at two main areas: application security and data loss prevention. Application security ensures that applications are protected from the attackers by accessing the network. Data loss prevention implements technologies and processes to ensure that staffers don’t deliberately or inadvertently send sensitive data outside the network.
	<p>
	<h2> Hien: </h2>
	<p>
	My ideal job would be a Graphic Database Developer. This position applies the concept of Network Topologies in designing and developing use cases that meet business stakeholder requirements. Treating the relationships between data as equally important to the data itself, a Graphic Database Developer is able to use graph databases to store, process and query connections efficiently. The idea of organising and manipulating data into a coherent visual map is especially appealing to me.
	</p>

	<br>

	<h2>
	The ideal fields for each group member are: software engineering, data science, data and business intelligence analysis, cyber security, network security and graphic database developer.
	</h2>

	<p>
	One of the common job interests are data science and data/business intelligence analysis, where some of the shared skills include data modelling, knowledge in programming languages, problem solving, creating/analyzing data, expressing data, teamwork and having a decent knowledge in the mathematical field. Another common job interest amongst our team is cybersecurity and network security, where some skills are in risk analysis and mitigation, intrusion detection, security analysis, programming languages and malware analysis and reversing. Although software engineering is of a different field, there are similar skills needed such as programming languages and problem solving. For graphic designing, the skills here are focused on organising and manipulating data into an appealing map. Another required skill that everyone will need is great teamwork and strong communication.	
	</p>

	<p>
	In software engineering, the focus is on applying concepts of engineering to develop software, which is different from data science and analysis, where they aid businesses and enhance company products through analysing data. There is also a contrast when compared to security, where the attention is on security and data loss prevention with aspects of problem solving. Although each member has a different role of interest, we share a common goal that is to succeed in our careers. In regards to career plans, the team has similarities in which we want to complete our Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology, get internships, begin networking and make our way up in the IT industry.
