<p>Angel showed interest to work on our project and was dedicated to the development of the assignment. He were not to be present at a couple of meetings, but he would watch the recordings, read the agenda notes and do the work as required. He also conducted one interview and shared interesting facts from his interviewee.</p>

<p>Derek was a proactive member and committed to take actions and tasks as it was needed. He was punctual for the meetings and contributed with his thoughts to the group discussions. Derek was not afraid to take more tasks if it was needed of him.</p>

<p>Melanie was actively present in all meetings and channels used for communication. She took good care of our agenda, taking notes on designated tasks and pending parts of the assignment. She shared her own project idea with us and was happy to let it become a group project.</p>

<p>Patrick used his technical skills to create a group repository on GitHub, managed the branch master and also helped us use the repository. During the meetings, his contributions also came from his communications skills that engaged the team in discussions. Patrick interviewed an IT worker from overseas and brought in context of what is the industry like in the US.</p>

<p>Because of a big misunderstanding, Hien Tran’s email was added incorrectly in the Microsoft Team and that created some confusion during the project for the team and for him. <br>
Hien had access to our google drive, where we created the documents and kept our agenda, every week he would add his contribution for team profile and ideal jobs as we added ours. This shows that Hien was committed to work on our project. In our last week we finally clarified what was happening and had him added to our meetings.
Hien took care of working on a HTML template and was engaged in the discussion. </p> 


Group Reflection individual paragraph:
<p>I think we formed a well engaged group who were motivated to do well in the assignment. We hold two meetings each week and the other days we could easily reach each other through chat or email. All members of our group contributed to the final result of the assignment.<br>
During our meeting we acknowledged each other’s ideas and engaged in productive discussions.</pr>

<p>A aspect that could be improved would be to have tasks delegated earlier. This would have assisted us to plan the work better and be comfortable knowing that the job would have been done well and on time. A project timeline could have contributed too.</p>

<p>One fact that surprised me was the presence of Hien in the meetings of our last week. Due to miscommunications Hien were not able to find where we were meeting weekly. That did not stop Hien to contribute with his individual work and once he joined our meeting he was willing to help with all pending tasks.</p>

<p>From this group work I have learned that people may have different expectations and motivations for a project and as part of a group we have to be understanding of it and learn how to arrive at an agreement.</p>
