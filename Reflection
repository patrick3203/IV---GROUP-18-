I don’t have any complaints at all in regard to the performance of our group as I firmly believe we make a great team. The group worked extremely well together, we all respected and got along with one another. There were no issues with the communication. When we needed to reach out to a certain member, we could do so at any given time and rely on one another. There was never a moment where conflict occurred and everyone showed enthusiasm when assigned tasks. Each person demonstrated great teamwork skills and there was a consistency in completing tasks, where each member showed they put in a great amount of effort. There was never a moment of doubt and I felt I could count on each person to do an amazing job. When it came to sharing ideas, we all listened and were open to hearing different points of views. Despite there being a mix-up with one of our members, there were no hard feelings and the team was welcoming. That member displayed great technical skills and our team was able to further progress in our assignment. Each member possessed great skills in communication and patience, further displaying their drive to do well, which I believe is what makes us a great team.

One thing that could be improved was the communication between one of our members. There was a mix up where we had been contacting the wrong person, thinking that it was our team member. This led to confusion for the past few weeks but eventually we had sorted it out. This was a learning experience for us, teaching us that we should always double check each member’s emails. In regard to GitHub, it was very confusing initially. As we continued to use it, the easier it became to understand. I believe that using GitHub is somewhat successful in showing each member’s workload, however it is a bit tedious and many errors would occur, making it difficult and frustrating to use.
