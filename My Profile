<h1 style="color:blue;font-size:40px;">Welcome to Patrick's Profile!</h1> 
<p> I am 19 years old and I am a Full-Time international student originally from the United States. I am a first year student in the Bachelor of IT program. I fly drones in my spare time, as well I am an amteur boxer. I speak English as my primary language however I am moderately proficient in Spanish. My interest comes from wanting to know how everything works, I extend that curiosity to computers. The feeling you receive after successfully completing something you’ve been working on for weeks keeps me going. It’s the pinnacle of all the hours of work you put in and now it is represented all in one area. <p>
<p> Each members’ personality test result is as follows: <p>
<p> Ary: ENTP & Tactile learner <p>
<p> Melanie: ESFP-T & Tactile/Kinesthetic <p>
<p> Patrick: ESFJ-T & Tactile <p>
<p> Derek: ISFJ & Auditory <p>
<p> Angel: ISFJ-T & Visual <p>
<p> Hien: INFP-A & Auditory/Visual <p>

<p> The team consists of three extraverts and three introverts, however, this does not determine our team's compatibility. According to the test results, each member is somewhat compatible with one another. By acknowledging each other's personality type, we are able to gather insights on everyone's strengths and weaknesses in regards to teamwork. One member's weakness is another member's strength. With this in mind, we can use this to our advantage and allocate roles in favour of our strongest traits. <p>
<h1> Ideal Jobs <h1>
<p> The ideal IT job for me would be within the Cybersecurity field. Specifically, I would like to work in the Cyber Risk department for a large organization. I like the problem-solving aspect of Cyber Risk, you are presented with new challenges every day that must be solved. As well you must be able to effectively and clearly communicate with team members which is something I feel I am good at. The requirements for this type of position are typically a Bachelor degree in a related field, as well as a few years of experience in the Cybersecurity field. <p>
