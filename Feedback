Ary: 
Ary is almost like the leader of our group. He contributed the most and was always organised with his tasks and completed them accordingly. His performance was great and was kind to all group members. He was also open to different opinions and ideas, as well as raised his own great ideas. 
Derek:
Without a fail Derek was organised and on top of his work, additionally volunteering to assist Ary with his tasks. He participated every meeting and was always prepared. Furthermore, there was never any conflict with him. He shared great ideas and showed that he was serious about this assignment. 
Patrick:
Patrick is always enthusiastic and constantly shared his many ideas. He completed his set tasks consistently and offered to do the technical tasks that no one else could. He was always extremely friendly to every group member and never complained about the workload.  
Angel:
Angel is kind and regularly completed his tasks. He always seemed enthusiastic about the next set of work assigned to him and would do his part almost immediately when asked. Although he was a bit quiet and shy, he would share his ideas when necessary, adding great comments and contributions.
Hien:
There was a bit of confusion on Hienâ€™s part but eventually, it came together. When we were finally able to reach out to him, he showed great technical skills and was eager to do any work that had not already been done. Most of the writing part of the project had been done but he was able to put everything together.
