The smart mirror is designed for individuals that want to maximise the space in the house as the smart mirror is a mirror with 
technology built into it. It creates an ease for access for  the individual as it has the ability to be controlled through voice or phone.
The mirror provides several different types of functions, such as the ability to create daily reminders, the current time, weather, etc. ,
to help serve the purpose of displaying information dependent on what the user prefers through ability to customise in settings. 
The design is to create a “main” mirror, preferred to be located in the living/lounge room, where there are smaller versions which can 
be accessed in different rooms around the house allowing it to be more accessible.
