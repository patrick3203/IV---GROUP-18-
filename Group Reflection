One thing that could be improved was the communication between one of our members. There was a mix up where we had been contacting the wrong person, thinking that it was our team member. This led to confusion for the past few weeks but eventually we had sorted it out. This was a learning experience for us, teaching us that we should always double check each member’s emails. In regard to GitHub, it was very confusing initially. As we continued to use it, the easier it became to understand. I believe that using GitHub is somewhat successful in showing each member’s workload, however it is a bit tedious and many errors would occur, making it difficult and frustrating to use.
