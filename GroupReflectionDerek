I believe that everyone in our group has contributed a fair amount as the tasks performed in this assignment were spread out and everyone has completed their own personal share. The only problem that occurred during our group on assignment 2 was the confusion or mix up that occurred to the member in our group that was mistaken as a librarian working in Vietnam. We were all capable in completing the tasks given on time through teamwork and communication. Our group worked very well with each other as everyone was able to communicate their ideas freely and each member's point of view. Due to the accident, we were able to acknowledge our mistake and clear it up, welcoming them to the team and allocate any tasks that need to be completed for the member to contribute to the group. Overall, I believe that our group has worked well together and have put in our best effort which can be seen through the collaboration of the members, communication and seeking help and completing the task that is given to the best of their ability.
