I believe that everyone in our group has contributed a fair share and have worked well together in a team. The work has been divided between the members in the group and all have contributed to the work. Something that was surprising was the amount of apple biting in when we were talking and recording in our session. What I learned from working in this team is that everyone is willing do to the work that is given to them and work together as a whole. Most of our group work is done over Google Drive, Microsoft teams and individual word document however I assume that we have placed our own share in our own contribution branch. We use Microsoft teams to record our meeting and collaborate with each member in the group and collaborate on Google Drive as everyone can access and edit on it. There has been a mix up between a member in the group. So basically, we added the correct student (Hien) to the Google drive and a librarian that is in Vietnam with the same name to Microsoft Teams. What confused the members in our group was that the student had access to Google Drive however they did not have access to Microsoft Teams, hence they could not access the meetings and the Librarian was added to the Microsoft Teams which was not supposed to be in the group. We then private messaged the librarian (in Microsoft Teams) that if they were a student or not, as “they” were editing the Google Drive document which was the student instead. Hien (student) was using the google document chat confused about how we were communicating until we have realised that he could only access the google drive but not Microsoft teams and then the problem was solved.
