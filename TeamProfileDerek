Personal Information: (Note: I seperated line 3-6, 11-15, 20-24 so I can see instead of having one very long line)
  Derek Jiang - s3844786
  I was born in Australia, while both my parents came from China. I can speak and understand both Chinese and English. 
  I enjoy playing sports especially basketball where I played for a club (Central City Breakers) and swimming when I took lessons. 
  I am in the Bachelor of Information Technology Course where I have a major interest in the data science area of IT. 
  I have little knowledge in the IT field however I hope to learn it in more detail as IT is always evolving and achieving new heights.

Ideal Job:
  Data and Business Intelligence analyst is a job position in a company that gathers data and turns the data into information that can 
  be used to help aid the businesses decision making often through interpreting the data gathered. It is appealing to me because I enjoy 
  interpreting data and analyzing the information to then come up with a solution to a problem that is supported through the data
  gathered. The skills required for this position is that you will need to know programming languages, be good at problem solving,
  creating/analyzing data and expressing the data, teamwork and have a decent knowledge in the mathematical field.

Personality tests:
  My personality test reflects that even though I may be shy, I will get tasks done on time. I am patient with my tasks given, 
  having a much for steady and straight forward approach to help achieve the end goal. I learn better by hearing and listening by
  storing the information in the brain by the way it sounds. The big 5 personality test reflects that as an individual, I am organised
  and work towards the goals that are set (a high percentage in Conscientiousness). Agreeableness is rather moderate as I acknowledge
  other opinions and their personal perspectives and put them side to side with my own opinion.
