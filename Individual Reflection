I donâ€™t have any complaints at all in regard to the performance of our group as I firmly believe we make a great team. The group worked extremely well together, we all respected and got along with one another. There were no issues with the communication. When we needed to reach out to a certain member, we could do so at any given time and rely on one another. There was never a moment where conflict occurred and everyone showed enthusiasm when assigned tasks. Each person demonstrated great teamwork skills and there was a consistency in completing tasks, where each member showed they put in a great amount of effort. There was never a moment of doubt and I felt I could count on each person to do an amazing job. When it came to sharing ideas, we all listened and were open to hearing different points of views. Despite there being a mix-up with one of our members, there were no hard feelings and the team was welcoming. That member displayed great technical skills and our team was able to further progress in our assignment. Each member possessed great skills in communication and patience, further displaying their drive to do well, which I believe is what makes us a great team.
